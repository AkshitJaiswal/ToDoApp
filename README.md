Hello , Thanks for showing interest in my project ToDoApp .
I have made this project so that i can grasp a good concept in the HTML , CSS , JavaScript .
This is a Basic project where we can add events to do and after the event is done we can easily remove the task .
It is very helpful in remembering things that we have to do .
